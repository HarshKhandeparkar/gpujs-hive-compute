### Installation And Usage

The package is available on npm and can be installed using `npm`/`yarn`.

yarn add gpujs-hive-compute

#### In the browser
Browser usage is theoretically possible but I will probably put it in a separate repo later.

The library has two core components, the **Helper** and the **Leader**.
